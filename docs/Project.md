# Project


# Done

FS - no longer returns the names of clients in status message.

# To Do

* Build out Example Application
    * Get status/versions of services (FS & UaaS)
    * Generate key endpoint?

* Financing Service (FS)
    * Get FS to use UaaS

* UTXO as a Service (UaaS)
    * Get UaaS to provide additional interface


# Nice to have
* Prometheus/Grafana for System Monitoring?
    * Do we get this free with K8s?

* Date format consitent in status message

# Questions
How do we call generate_key from tx-engine?

Does not appear to be included in dist
installed in `/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/tx_engine`

Could just provide instructions 
(Or provide an endpoint for generating new keys).
