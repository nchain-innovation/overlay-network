# Overlay Network

The Overlay Network provides an API that Applications can use to interact with the blockchain. The Overlay Network API provides the ability to:
* Fund transactions
* Broadcast transactions
* Capture transactions


# Components
The following diagram shows the key components that make up the system.

In this project we have provided an `Example Application` which uses the `Overlay Network`. The idea is that once you understand how the example application works you can replace it with your own application
